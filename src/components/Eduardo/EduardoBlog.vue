                    My piano has been my soulmate since I was five years old.
                    Together we have transformed notes on a page to beautiful
                    music more times than I can count. Those melodies speak to
                    me and consume me as I learn to play each one; they seem to
                    transform into a warm cloak that I wear wrapped around me.
                    <br /><br />
                    Each time I began learning a new song, I found myself
                    absorbed by the melody, inspired by rhythm. Sometimes I
                    would find myself so immersed in the song that I
                    incorporated it into my daily life. My daily routine swelled
                    or slowed following the cadence for each piece.
                    <br /><br />
                    There was only one problem, every single time I started
                    learning a new song I found myself rushing through it,
                    anxious to perfect each note, wanting to reach the end and
                    be finished. I specifically remember ‚ÄúF√ºr Elise,‚Äù a work
                    composed by Ludwig Van Beethoven, which I absolutely loved.
                    I just loved the tempo and the movement of my fingers as I
                    paced through the song and slowed down in crucial moments in
                    order to bring out the suspense for the audience.
                    <br /><br />
                    This beautiful piece ebbs and flows in its melody, bringing
                    the listener on its journey. As I played ‚ÄúF√ºr Elise,‚Äù I
                    began to compare this melody to my life. I noticed how my
                    life was just a quick, sudden flash of every little thing,
                    nothing making its mark, nothing very significant. I was
                    rushing through life just as I rushed through the songs.
                    <br /><br />
                    ‚ÄúF√ºr Elise‚Äù was my catalyst to slow down. While I practiced
                    this song to perfection, I found I didn't want it to come to
                    an end. I wanted it to continue so I could enjoy it longer.
                    As I compared the movement of the song to the passage of my
                    daily life, I knew I was missing out on the intricacies and
                    details of my life. I was in a hurry to finish, and now that
                    I am 17 and preparing for my next ‚Äúcomposition,‚Äù I realize I
                    want to slow down.
                    <br /><br />
                    I want to enjoy every single moment of my senior year, I
                    don't want to hurry through it in any way. I know that just
                    like the end of my favorite musical piece, my high school
                    years will end, and I think I want to play this song a
                    little longer.
